Heres our project. 
We promise we didnt start it a week before it was due :3

To get started with our project, run the following commands

git clone https://github.com/ChristopherM2/CP317/

cd CP317
make sure to have python3 and npm installed on your machine

as well as a google firebase service account key in 

run "run program_windows" or run_program_mac depending on your operating system

windows should install the required packages and start the server (if it doesnt manually install python and nodejs on your computer)
NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager \
